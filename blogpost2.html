                    The above-stated kalam is considered Amir Khusroh’s one of
                    the finest works, where he is seen praising his spiritual
                    mentor Hazrat Nizamuddin Awliyah.&nbsp;There has been widely
                    accepted conjecture that Amir’s devotion to his awliyah
                    wasn’t exclusively limited to his spiritual, religious needs
                    but also his romantic affiliations.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ancient Indian art and architecture, since time immemorial,
                    has depicted a few scattered references to same-sex unions.
                    Sexual fluidity has been portrayed in our ancient texts like
                    Kamasutra, which acknowledged the existence of Tritiya
                    panthi&nbsp;(the third gender), and in the depiction of the
                    homoerotic sculptures at temples like Khajuraho, Konark and
                    Hampi . There is no living evidence of homosexuality being
                    outlawed, existing from the precolonial era. Satirically, it
                    was our white masters, the Victorians, who imposed this
                    quaint sense of morality on us. A majority of the Indian
                    population went on to become the inheritors of a mindset
                    which scandalized sex and related practices, while the
                    Victorians became successful in their pursuit of erasing our
                    past.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On October 6, 1860, the Indian Law Commission, presided over
                    by Lord TB Macaulay, introduced section 377 of the Indian
                    Penal Code.&nbsp;The intend of the section was to punish the
                    offence of buggery, sodomy and bestiality. However, it went
                    on to criminalize all forms of sexual practices which did
                    not come under the purview of heterosexual activities or
                    sexual activities performed for any purpose, other than
                    procreation. The long-drawn battle against Section 377
                    culminated with the Supreme Court judgement of September 6,
                    2018. The court ruled that the application of Section 377 to
                    consensual homosexual sex between adults was
                    unconstitutional, indefensible, and arbitrary , and thus
                    decriminalised the consensual practices.&nbsp;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On a careful analysis of the above judgement, Navtej Singh
                    Johar v The Union of India , an optimist might argue that it
                    has principally laid down a precise road map for future
                    judges to rely upon. It can be interpreted to rule that
                    ‘gay’ marriage can be (and should be) permitted in India.
                    The judgement was based on the idea of the ability of a
                    person, belonging to the LGBTQIA+ community, to love a
                    member of the same sex. Consequently, giving them a right
                    that their relationship will be treated as equal to that of
                    a heterosexual couple.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The fundamental basis of the Art. 14 and Art. 21 arguments,
                    i.e., the right to equality and the right to freedom
                    argument in the above-cited judgement, are to allow every
                    individual to achieve their autonomy. Every soul should have
                    the right to choose their sexual partner or their partner in
                    life, irrespective of their gender or sexual orientation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The contention that now arises is that the moment you allow
                    one to have an intimate relationship with any person of
                    their choice, irrespective of any bias, logically then
                    marriage is nothing but a legal sanction. Marriage, in this
                    sense, becomes a societal construct.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There have been (and will be) instances where a minuscule
                    portion of a society prefers a notion or aspires to put into
                    practice a phenomenon that is deemed “different” from a
                    majoritarian lens. What we need to understand here is that
                    this portion is impeccably competent to have the freedom, to
                    be different and thus prefer different things, as long as
                    their unique tastes remain within the legal framework and do
                    not result in the abridgement of fundamental rights of any
                    other citizen.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Any attitude which according to the societal purview is
                    distorted, must at the bare minimum be afforded an
                    environment in which it could perpetuate, if not promoted,
                    provided it is within the constitutional framework. If such
                    an approach isn’t adopted, freedom of expression would fail
                    to prosper and the right to liberty and freedom, which is
                    the epitome of constitutional morality, would cease to
                    survive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We, the people of India, have solemnly resolved to
                    constitute India into a sovereign, socialist, secular and a
                    democratic republic where virtues such as justice, liberty,
                    equality and fraternity will be secured to each citizen,
                    irrespective of any bias or binary . Even when the (highly
                    subjective) principles and morals in the society remain as
                    orthodox or rigid as possible, nevertheless, the
                    constitutional provisions will apply because India is a
                    country of constitutional supremacy&nbsp;and not a country
                    built upon majoritarian demands and societal acceptance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Surveys have indicated that a large majority of homosexual
                    men in India (including MSMs; self-identified heterosexual
                    men who, nonetheless, indulge in sexual practices with other
                    men outside their immediate household) are married in
                    heterosexual setups.&nbsp;This might look like a trivial
                    issue at first glance but is quite detrimental to the
                    societal wellbeing, which the so-called ethical majority is
                    aggressively trying to protect. Such men are forced to fit
                    in within the heteronormative setup of their surroundings
                    and never truly acknowledge the double life they are living.
                    Human dignity and integrity of the individual deteriorate.
                    The argument here is more legal than moral in the sense that
                    the wife here is devoid of her right to demand a divorce on
                    the grounds of infidelity and remains deceived
                    throughout.&nbsp;

                    The belief that a biologically born male is exclusively
                    sexually attracted to a biologically born female is what is
                    called heterosexism. This idea has become a hegemonic
                    construction of heterosexuality through performativity .

                    Legal recognition will carve the path for easy property
                    transfers (after the uncertain death of any spouse),
                    gender-neutral implementation of adoption rights and
                    inheritance policies. On a moral front, it can also be
                    argued that when a certain phenomenon gets legal validation,
                    the inclusion of it in the society not only becomes simpler
                    but also, perhaps, speeds-up substantially.

                    Recent judicial developments, demanding recognition of
                    same-sex unions within the Special Marriage Act or Hindu
                    Marriage Act, have also taken place. However, for any of
                    these to be implemented, a bill will have to be passed in a
                    Parliamentary body for the required amendment of the already
                    existing and related legislations. The need of the hour is
                    to make our laws, related to familial constructs and unions,
                    much more gender-neutral, omitting the words such as wife
                    and husband and replacing them with partner or spouse.

                    However, judicial interpretation even in situations like
                    these has proved to be a boon for society. In a landmark
                    judgement (in April last year), the Madras High Court held
                    that the expression “bride” in Section 5 of the Hindu
                    Marriage Act, 1955 can be extended, in its meaning, to
                    include a transwoman, an intersex person and/or a
                    transgender person who perceives herself as a woman.&nbsp;
                    On the other hand, in Shafin Jahan v. Asikan K.M. , the
                    right to marry any person of one’s choice was held to be an
                    integral part of Article 21 of the Constitution.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sex cannot be seen through a lens of morality, especially
                    when morality itself is highly subjective. The reference to
                    heterosexual love as “normal”, and, by implication,
                    homosexual love as “abnormal”, is a smack of homophobia. The
                    whole point of decriminalization was to show that homosexual
                    love is not different from any other type of love. To call
                    homosexuality an ‘inclination’ or a ‘tendency’ as opposed to
                    a ‘preference’ would again be unjust.

                    Therefore, marriage equality is essential to fulfil the
                    vision of our honorable Constitution makers in which they
                    envisaged a society build on the virtues of liberty,
                    equality and integrity.
