                    <p>Women, no matter what the territorial land they reside in, have always faced suppression of their basic human
                      rights, and continue to face the brunt of any socio-political or economic crisis. When there is a pragmatic shift in
                      the nature of ‘governance’ or a sight of crashing economy, it is the women of a country who are subjugated to harsh
                      humility and grave violation in the hands of this very ‘patrilineal’ society. Even if one looks beyond the scope of
                      public sphere humiliation, we will still find women sobbing in their respective families, fighting for the smallest
                      of necessities let alone the urge to secure the same status as the male figure. In the closed perimeter of their
                      homes, women face emotional and physical abuse degrading their health and even the prospect of death in many cases.
                      One such country which has failed at respecting their women over a multiple decade long crisis, is Afghanistan. From
                      the strict contingent rules of the Soviet regime, the Radical Fundamentalists of the Islamic State to the US allied
                      formed post-Taliban era of the early 200s, and again to the newly formed government of the Taliban in accordance
                      with strict, ‘wrongful’ interpretation of the Sharia law; it is the Afghan women who have continuously struggled to
                      affirm their identities and maintain their status in both public and private spheres.</p>
                    <p>This continuous cycle of oppression and dehumanization has called for a humanitarian crisis in this war- torn
                      nation. After the Taliban takeover, women now especially find themselves in a miserable situation, helpless to
                      accord with their dignity and are ‘merely’ living their lives in fear of an uncertain future. Women, now, are in an
                      even worse position that they have ever been, forcing them to live in accordance with the codified regulations set
                      up by the insurgent organization Taliban. They are restricted in terms of their clothing as now a woman is required
                      to cover up from head to bottom, or else they will be penalized with capital punishment. They have little to no say
                      in her interests related to education, allowing them to be either associated with studies related to medicine or
                      academia, or else they are required to willfully fulfill their duties of household and provide childcare. Moreover,
                      in higher educational institutes, women and men are now forced to attend separate classes since the interaction
                      between the two genders is treacherous in the eyes of the new Emirate. <sup><a href="#ref1">[i]</a></sup> In a
                      century where the world is continuously progressing towards the upliftment of humanity as a whole, Taliban occupied
                      Afghanistan fails to adhere with the principles of morality and humanism. By forcing their ‘fundamentalist’ opinions
                      on its citizens, it is devaluing the lives of millions of its citizens residing in its territory with the optimistic
                      hope of a better Afghanistan. </p>
                    <p>In spite of the ruckus created in the hands of the insurgents, Afghanistan has witnessed the roaring sounds of
                      women across its streets protesting for their rights and status. Recently, after the announcement of an all-male
                      interim government with at least 14 of 33 members on the UNSC's terrorism blacklist for Afghanistan, women in Kabul
                      protested for the adequate representation of women at higher positions of administration. <sup><a
                          href="#ref2">[ii]</a></sup> Knowing that such rallies and protests could cost them their life, Afghan women
                      showcased their brave demeanor against the Taliban fighters. They demanded the inclusion of rights related to women,
                      adequate representation and their fundamental right to equality. However, such enormous voices were devalued with
                      beatings and arrests across the region. </p>
                    <p> The newly ‘self-acclaimed’ government with no international recognition has been rejected by most of the Afghan
                      population. However, there are some rural territories and villages which have regarded this sudden change in power
                      in an optimistic purview. They feel that the true essence of their country has been restored after the massive
                      killings in the decade long war. However, at the same time, their narrative involves no value to women life, and is
                      rather filled with misogyny and conservatism. For a nation to succeed, it is fairly important for the state
                      authorities to provide its citizens its fundamental rights. Especially, in a country like Afghanistan, where the
                      majority population still strives for agriculture to earn its livelihood, men and women need to be more vigilant in
                      moving towards the ideals of education and equality. </p>
                    <p>With the current trend in resistance against the insurgents, it is fair to say that women of this generation will
                      continue to showcase their disagreement with the coherent provisions. Their resistance is a representation of
                      defiance with the narrowed perspective of viewing women as ‘commodities’ in the societal set up of men regarded as
                      the ‘superior’ race. It calls out the persisting ideals of radicalism associated to ‘religion’. Where women are very
                      easily feared to believe that this gross discrimination (in the hands of men) as the ultimate wish of the divine
                      power. While, in reality, such an interpretation is just used to enlighten their stature (men’s stature) next to God
                      and has nothing to do with the true essence of any religion. The Afghan women of today, are more mindful than they
                      were in the last Taliban period of occupation and are engrossed in this fight of resistance. And their will
                      hopefully give them everything that they strive to acquire in the future.</p>
